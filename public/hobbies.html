<h1>Hobbies</h1>

<h2>Gardening</h2>
<p>I love to grow vegetables and flowers.  I like to start my vegetable seeds indoors around April.  I would start earlier but our weather is not warm enough.  I like to grow vegetables I can later can.  I like to make jellies also but I have to buy my fruits from local fruit stands for that.</p>
<p>I have many varieties of flowers around my home.  I like to plant them so that I can see the different blooms and colors throughout the seasons.  My flowers begin blooming in March and finish around October.</p>


<h2>Crafts</h2>
<p>Crafting is a great stress reliever for me.  I enjoy many different types of crafts.  I like to crochet small projects that have intricate patterns.</p>
<p>I have also done some jewelry making.  I have used wire and jems to create beautiful necklaces, rings and bracelets.  I had an Etsy shop in the past where I would sell my pieces.</p>
<p>I got into paper planners a few years ago.  This is like scrapbooking but with stickers instead of photos.  I found I was spending quite a bit of money buying the stickers so I decided to make my own.  I did quite a bit of research and taught myself how to use the silhouette design studio software.  I sold some of my stickers as digital downloads through my Etsy shop.  Now I offer free sticker sets through my blog.</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>I love to learn how to use new technology.  As mentioned above I taught myself to use the Silhouette design studio software.  I also learned how to use the Cricut design space.  I have a Facebook group where I offer my planner stickers for free and I am always helping others learn how to access those files.</p>
<p>Now that I am an empty nester I have decided to learn web development.  With the help of the Udemy Web Development Bootcamp I hope to soon be able to develop websites and other projects.</p>
